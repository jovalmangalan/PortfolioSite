      <h3>Snake Game (Grade 11 Final Project)</h3>
      <p>
        Back in Grade 11, one of my biggest projects was building a Snake game in Python.
        It was the first time I really got into game development, and it helped me learn a lot
        about how programming logic works. The idea was simple, do the best I can to clone the orginal snake game.
        Looking back on it, it does look terrible and is also very unoptimized but I'm still proud of it and even prouder of how far I've come

      <h3>Papi Joe's Shawarmania (Grade 12 Final Project)</h3>
      <p>
        In Grade 12, I challenged myself with something more creative, so I made a parody cooking
        game called <strong>Papi Joe’s Shawarmania</strong>. The goal was to build rice bowls and
        shawarmas for customers, inspired by games like Papa’s Pizzeria.

      <h3>Healthcare Appointment App (Year 2 College Project)</h3>
      <p>
        Later on, I built a desktop application for booking healthcare appointments.
        The app let patients enter their name, select a doctor, and book an appointment
        time that was then stored in a database. This project helped me practice UI
        design, data handling, and connecting frontend and backend logic.
