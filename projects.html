      <h2>My Projects</h2>

      <!-- Line Following Robot FIRST -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Line-Following Robot (Grade 10 Computer Engineering Project)</h3>
        <p>
          In Grade 10, I built a <strong>Line-Following Robot</strong> using LEGO Mindstorms NXT. 
          The robot used <strong>light sensors</strong> to detect black tape on the floor and 
          adjusted its motors in real-time, allowing it to autonomously follow the path. 
          This project introduced me to robotics, sensors, and control systems, sparking my 
          early interest in engineering and programming.

      <!-- Snake Game -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Snake Game (Grade 11 Final Project)</h3>
        <p>
          Back in Grade 11, one of my biggest projects was building a Snake game in Python. 
          It was my first time really getting into game development, and it helped me learn a lot about 
          programming logic. The idea was simple: clone the original snake game. Looking back on it, 
          it does look terrible and is very unoptimized, but I’m still proud of it.

      <!-- Shawarmania -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Papi Joe’s Shawarmania (Grade 12 Final Project)</h3>
        <p>
          In Grade 12, I challenged myself with something more creative. I made a parody cooking game 
          called <strong>Papi Joe’s Shawarmania</strong>, inspired by Papa’s Pizzeria. The goal was to 
          build rice bowls and shawarmas for customers. It gave me a chance to combine coding with creativity.

      <!-- Healthcare App -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Healthcare Appointment App (Year 2 University Project)</h3>
        <p>
          In my second year, I built a healthcare appointment app using Python and Tkinter. 
          This project focused on user interface design and backend logic for scheduling and 
          managing appointments. It solidified my understanding of object-oriented programming 
          and real-world application development.
